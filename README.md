## Introduction

Generative AI is transforming the way we interact with technology. It allows machines to create content, simulate environments, and generate responses that feel natural. This repository aims to compile resources that showcase the capabilities of generative AI across various modalities. 

Whether you are a researcher, developer, or enthusiast, you will find valuable tools and projects here. 

## Features

- **Talking Heads**: Create realistic animated avatars that can mimic human speech and expressions.
- **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: Convert spoken language into written text with high accuracy.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Generate natural-sounding speech from text input.
- **Image Generation**: Produce high-resolution images using advanced diffusion models.
- **Video Generation**: Create videos based on text descriptions or images.
- **Multimodal Capabilities**: Integrate different types of data, such as audio, text, and visuals.
